<blockquote>
<p><b>precipitate.bio</b> came out of need. <i>In situ</i> technology is confusing
and fickle. (<i>Is DNA-Paint different from OligoPaint? Answer:
Yes.</i>) While working on FISSEQ technology, I was inspired by the
amazing pace of technology advancement in imaging single molecules
inside cells and tissues. However, keeping up with the state of the
field was almost a job in itself! And often, when I actually used one
of these methods, the &ldquo;methods&rdquo; section was far from a
complete protocol. I hope <b>precipitate.bio</b> is the place to go for
critical insights and advice, a trustworthy knowledge base, the friend
who pings you to ask if you&rsquo;ve seen that new paper, and the
reviewer who suggests that one more experiment &mdash; in short,
my goal is to create a community of in situ technology
enthusiasts.</p>
